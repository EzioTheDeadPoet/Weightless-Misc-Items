## What is this ?

This is an Customizable Inventory System Overhaul that, allows you to rebalance your game, by removing the weight from non combat related items and standardizing the combat item weights in slot classes based onn their original carryweights.

But what about Standing Stones, Perks and other ways of increasing your carry capacity ? Well all those are nerfed as well (by a factor of your choosing).

## How to use/install ?

select tag and make sure âœ…Auto is checked to use the latest version.
